# NAME

git-dit - the distributed issue tracker for git


# SYNOPSIS

git [git options] dit \<command\> [\<args\>]


# DESCRIPTION

Git-dit is a distributed issue tracking system based on the git revision
control system.
Following some of the design principles of git, it offers both high level
commands for end users as well as a low level interface to internals for use in
scripts or third-party extensions.

For more information, refer to the DISCUSSION section of this manual.
Additionally, the WORKFLOWS section provides some examples of git-dit usage.


# OPTIONS

There are no git-dit specific global options, contrary to sub-commands of
git-dit.
The `-h` short option usually prints a short help message listing all options
and command line arguments accepted by a specific sub-command.


# GIT-DIT COMMANDS

Like git, the git-dit suite is divided into high level ("porcelain") commands
and low level ("plumbing") commands.


# HIGH LEVEL COMMANDS (PORCELAIN)

## git-dit-new
    Add a new issue.

## git-dit-reply
    Reply to an existing issue with a new message.

## git-dit-show
    Show the contents (messages) of an issue.

## git-dit-list
    List all issues known to git-dit in the current directory.

## git-dit-tag
    Show or modify meta-data of issues.

## git-dit-fetch
    Fetch issues from a remote repository.

## git-dit-push
    Push issues to a remote repository.


# LOW LEVEL COMMANDS (PLUMBING)

## git-dit-check-message
    Check whether the format of an issue message is valid.

## git-dit-check-refname
    Check whether a reference is a dit reference of a known type, by name.

## git-dit-create-message
    Create a bare message.

## git-dit-find-tree-init-hash
    Find the issue hash for a message's hash.

## git-dit-get-issue-tree-init-hashes
    List all known issue hashes.

## git-dit-get-issue-metadata
    Extract meta-data from a thread in an issue.


# DISCUSSION

Git-dit is modeled after classical mailing lists.
Issue messages, which are stored as commits in the repository, correspond to
Emails.
Each issue can be thought of as a discussion thread on a mailing list, whether
it be a bug-report, a feature request or a patch-set to be merged into some
branch.

The command `git-dit-new` creates a new issue, or discussion thread.
It can be either based on an existing commit, or as a new initial commit.
The latter one is most appropriate for feature requests and bug-reports, while
the former one is especially useful for patch-sets.
Discussion messages will be created using `git-dit-reply` as empty commits,
preserving the parent commit's tree.

Note that in any case the parentship of an initial message should only be
considered a reference.
The initial message will not be part of the branch it may refer to at some
point, and git-dit tools will not advance a branch if a new issue is created.

Each issue has a "head" reference, which references an "upstream" state of an
issue.
Metadata, such as assignments and the issue's status, is accumulated from an
issue's reference towards the issue's initial commit.
Additionally, a maintainer may use the "head" reference to communicate
acceptance of some discussion point.


# WORKFLOWS

Git-dit tries not to force a specific work-flow on its users.
Various workflows are supported either directly or indirectly.
This section discusses some possible workflows for managing issues using
git-dit.

## General setup considerations

Project hosting sites often provide exactly one logical issue tracker for each
project repository.
As with mailing lists and stand-alone issue tracking web-services, users of
git-dit are not forced to bind a set of issues to a specific source code
repository.
While Git-dit-issues do live in a git repository, it doesn't necessarily need to
be the same repository used for the source code.
For example, maintainers may choose to use separate repositories for code and
issues.

Consider, for example, a big project with several code repositories for
different components.
Now consider a user who wants to file a bug.
In many cases, the user will not be able to correctly assign the bug to a
specific component.
With git-dit, maintainers may provide a dedicated issue repository for filing
bug reports and feature requests.

Contributors and sub-maintainers may add the central issue repository as an
additional remote to their local clone.
Optionally, issues assigned to a component may be transferred or copied to a
component's code repository or an associated specialized issue repository
(though there is no convenient support for such functionality, yet).

It is also possible to have multiple issue repositories for a single code
repository.
Consider for example one of these closed source projects with many change
requests from difficult customers.
With git-dit, you can set up a dedicated issue repository for each customer in
order to accept and share change requests.
Developers can add each of those issue repositories as remotes, viewing and
interacting with all of the issues from different customers.

## Retrieving issues from a remote repository

Naturally, contributors as well as maintainers will want to retrieve issues from
a remote repository, be it a dedicated issue repository or a repository
containing both issues and source code.
Git-dit offers multiple ways for retrieving issues.

Issues may be fetched manually from a remote repository using the `fetch`
subcommand.

    git dit fetch issue-repo

will fetch all issues from a remote "issue-repo". The subcommand also supports
fetching only updates of issues explicitly specified or all issues which are
known to the current repository.

Alternatively, a developer may choose to subscribe to the issues present in a
remote repository.
Currently, this has to be done manually through a ref-spec.
The following refspec, for example, will cause the issues to be fetched from the
remote "origin" on each `git fetch`.

    refs/dit/*:refs/remotes/origin/dit/*

New issues and issue updates are pushed to a remote using git-dit's "push"
subcommand.

## Reporting an issue

Issues can be created in the local repository.

    git dit new

will spawn the editor configured for git.
The usual rules for commit messages also apply to issues: the first line will be
the subject line and should contain a summary or appropriate title; the second
line should be blank, followed by paragraphs of texts or blocks of trailers.
The trailers may be used for transporting metadata.
Once the message is written and the editor is closed, a new issue will be
created and git-dit will print the issue's id.

For others to see the issue, the issue has to be pushed to a public repository.
The command

    git dit push origin <id>

will push the issue with the id provided by the user to the remote "origin".
Alternatively, all local updates, including new issues, may be pushed to the
remote "origin" using the command

    git dit push origin

## Viewing issues

Issues can both be listed and viewed.
The command

    git dit list

lets the user view the issues known to the repository.
The list contains each issue's id, which the user may copy, e.g. into her
clipboard, for further use.

For example, an issue may be shown using a previously obtained id using the
command

    git dit show <issue-id>

This command displays the messages of an issue.
Multiple output formats are supported.
Most of them will contain the messages' ids.
Again, users may copy a message's id for further use, e.g. for replying to that
message.

## Adding information and metadata to an issue

Users may add information in the form of text and trailers to an issue by
replying to an issue message.
The command

    git dit reply <message-id>

spawns an editor for composing a reply to the message provided.
The message is handled (mostly) like a regular commit message:
the first line is a subject line;
the second line should be empty;
lines starting with a '#' are removed.
Trailers should go to the end of a message.

After the message is saved and the editor closed, the message will be added to
the issue.
It should now be visible via the "show" subcommand.

Currently, the new message only lives in the local repository.
In order to make it visible to others, users will usually want to push the new
message using the "push" subcommand.

Note that new metadata, e.g. the sate of an issue, added via a message is not
immediately adopted.
Rather it should be considered a proposal for a metadata change.
The remote repository's maintainer and possibly other moderating parties may
apply those proposed changes by updating the issue's "head" reference.

## Managing the state and other metadata of an issue

The "head" reference of an issue represents the "upstream state" of an issue.
The meatadata, e.g. status, of an issue is computed by accumulating the metadata
of messages from the head reference to the issue's initial message, only
following the first parent of each message.

Consider a bug-report consisting of the following tree of messages:

    A
    |
    B <- head
    |\
    C D
    |
    E
    |\
    F G

with "A" being the issue's initial message.

Now assume that in message "G", a developer volunteered fixing the bug by
assigning the issue to herself, projecting the changes necessary.
The maintainer may acknowledge the assignment by moving the head reference from
"B" to "G".

This change will also incorporate metadata changes performed in "C" and "E"
while omitting changes in "D" and "F".
Naturally, a maintainer cannot cherry-pick a single metadata change or
incorporate concurrent changes (e.g. from both "F" and "G") through mere
updating of the head reference.

However, a maintainer may maintain a separate branch of messages only
containing the subject and trailers.
The messages inspiring the changes may be references as additional parents of
those metadata-only messages.

This can be achieved using the "tag" subcommand. For example, given the tree
of messages above, the command

    git dit tag <issue> -s Dit-assignee='Foo Bar <foo.bar@example.com>' -r G

creates a message assigning the person "Foo Bar" to the issue, referencing the
message "G", and updates the "head" reference of the issue, yielding the
following DAG:


    A
    |
    B
    |\
    | \
    | |\
    | C D
    | |
    | E
    | |\
    | G F
    |/
    H <- head

with the link between "H" and "G" being only an informal reference.

Note that the maintainer may now also incorporate changes from the message "F"
in a similar way.
